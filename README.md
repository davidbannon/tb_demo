***This project is publicly readable, normally, a tomboy-ng Github repo would be marked as 'private'.***

This repo is a simple demo of how tomboy-ng notes might look if pushed to Github. Here I have used a set of the tomboy-ng help notes. As well as allowing you to view your notes, you could edit and sync them back to your tomboy-ng install. Editing can be done using github's markdown editor, not pretty but usable enough.

And you can use the github repo as a sync repository, syncing between multiple tomboy-ng installs.

The final system will probably list your notes either alphabetically or in groups defined by your Notebooks.

If you stumble across this project and wish to make a comment, please do so in the tomboy-ng repository.

*Please remember to ensure a reliable sync, you must not change files in the Meta directory.*
